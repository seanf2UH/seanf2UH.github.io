## The Online Library Community
Forum discussions, group discussions, and online community pools are some of the many different places that help provide a place for others to post their questions. These questions could be answered by pretty much be answered by anyone so a variety of answers can come in. But of course, the quality of the answer can be influenced by how the questions are delivered. 
## Creating the Right Question
A question for example that could be found easily by doing a quick Google search may receive a petty answer or no response at all. Suppose there is something that isn’t as quite as easy to find through a Google search or FAQ and such. Creating a forum is the next step and will need a concise area of focus when someone reads the title. As described in Raymond’s guidelines for effective forum interaction, being informative of your situation is helpful, but be also careful not to show distress as these questions can also be shrugged off. 
# Example that needs Improvements
An example that could use some improvement is when one was asking about how to create a room in a text-based game. The beginning of the description clearly states that they don’t want you to expect too much from them saying “I'm very new to Java and am not sure if I'm even allowed to ask questions of this nature here but I'll give it a shot.” and ending with “Remember that this isn't going to be pretty it's for practice and I need to do it within Java. Thanks in advance.” This kind of answer brings unnecessary content to the discussion and is something that finds some readers annoyed. 
## Volume
For the rest of the description, it seems that they have already started on their program but gave information almost unrelated to the subject of creating rooms. The usage for said rooms is to contain items and enemies that may be useful for said rooms but not too much on building the base for it leaving a bit of confusion. It feels like a dump of a lot of information but it is left to the reader to put it all together. Overall, it seems to be a misunderstanding of how object-oriented programming works with classes and functions rather than how to create the rooms themselves
# Example of Good Delivery!
But of course, there are some questions such as this discussion about why an array’s processing time that is sorted sorts much faster than an array that isn’t sorted. The description starts by showing the reader their code for the sorting function in C++ and the time it takes for each array. After it does so, they then create the equivalent in Java and yield a similar result with the processing time being shorter for a sorted array and longer for an unsorted array before wrapping it all back together and asking for an explanation for why they think this is happening. This question was kept concise, and straightforward, and did not go off into unnecessary information throughout the description. They did express their theory however but they quickly shut it down to avoid any possible open thinking in that direction. In response, many people gave a variety of answers but they all had one thing in common, there was a lot more work and thought put into their answers to help solve the problem because they knew what exactly they were dealing with and did feel bothered by any kind of useless writing or lack of or huge volumes of information.
# Conclusion
Reading about Raymond’s guidelines on smart questions and checking out other people’s posts has helped me see and understand how to properly make a good question post even if the program is not related to coding. It is a strong way to provide an effective discussion for the person seeking an answer and for the reader to deliver an answer they would be happy to help out with.
