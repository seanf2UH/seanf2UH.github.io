### I. Introduction
AI in the usage of education and software engineering has key characteristics that can help be used in the development and growth of these fields. Things such as developing steps to take to solve a certain issue or to help give a few tips to tackle several different assignments that could make things easier to assist on how a task could be completed. Of course, this is something that is used to help people. Not to outright replace people. AI only knows as much as it is given so answers could always be outdated and may inflict things that could hurt society in the long run. 
### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
	
   For the WODs, I never used any form of AI for the WODS. This is because while I was timed, I had to chance to try again without penalty. This is so I can still learn on my own and gain an idea of how I can create the program. Even if there is a more efficient way. Like what the title says, Experience is essential to have. 
  
  2. In-class Practice WODs
	
   Similar to Experience WOD, while it is also timed, I can put speed to the test and see what I can do without AI help. Part of my growth for myself is to get as little outside help as possible and be able to do things on my own. 
  
  3. In-class WODs

For the in-class WODs, I have utilized AI in a sense to help me understand how to approach the problem. With this, it’ll be easier to start producing code in a certain amount of time so that I am able to complete the WOD within the time limit. Of course, AI knows only as much as it is given so proper adjustments need to be made. So it is my responsibility to make sure it is correct. 
  
  4. Essays

For essays, I did not utilize AI at all for any of them. This is because the essays were more about my own experience or thoughts rather than anything else. It doesn’t feel like AI fits its role because we already should have the answer to our own experience. The only situation I can think of is how it can structure your essay for you based on the essay prompt and your question response. 
  
  5. Final project

For the final project, I used this to help design our project’s navbar, I knew how I wanted it to be built so I needed to make explain to it how it should look in a certain program format. I had to make sure that it functioned with the rest of our project and believe me, there were a ton of adjustments that needed to be made so that the pages and the navbar line up perfectly so that the other member's work doesn’t get interfered.
  
  6. Learning a concept/tutorial

When learning concepts, based on what I heard from other students in my class, the ai describing the concepts seems to be a lot more wordy and confusing than looking up a definition and examples from a top search. 
  
  7. Answering a question in class or Discord
	
 When answering a question in class or via Discord, we were either prompted to say what we thought or also encouraged to ask chat get. Both had their ups and downs but generally, questions that came from Discord were questions that also needed to be answered by another student due to being mostly assignment-related and generally not as well known to the AI database. So while I never actually answered a question through AI, giving another thought from your perspective generally helps the conversation lead to the correct answer.
  
  8. Asking or answering a smart question

The same could be said as what was mentioned in question seven. However, it is more likely you would want to human response since the question is again fairly specific. Having multiple answers to a question such as this would be really helpful and possible to combine several ideas together in order to solve it. While I also didn’t use AI here, it can still give its own view on how to approach this problem that could be used alongside human answers.
  
  9. Coding example e.g. “Give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

With AI, this result is produced. 

```cpp

const _ = require('underscore');
const cars = [
  { brand: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2018 },
  { brand: 'Honda', model: 'Civic', year: 2019 },
  { brand: 'Ford', model: 'Fiesta', year: 2017 }
];
const carNames = _.pluck(cars, 'brand');
console.log(carNames); // Output: ['Toyota', 'Honda', 'Ford']
```
  10. Explaining code

As I would explain it, it would be how pluck utilizes a stored list of objects and then literally plucks out certain information from the database. With AI, it is described “Underscore.js's pluck function is used to extract a list of property values from a collection of objects.” Depending on the complexity of the concept, responses can vary and produce a variety of results based on the concept 
  
  11. Writing code

I have used AI to help me write code for sure. This has helped save time and allowed me to produce code at a much quicker rate. Of course and understand what and why the AI chose this route. Make it easier to make the adjustments later for other produced code.
  
  12. Documenting code

So far haven’t yet used it to solely create code documentation as any that I don’t have written by AI are what I write myself. Code that is usually written by AI usually has premade documentation which makes it easier for me as the user to at least already have a basic understanding of what a particular function or line of code is doing.
  
  13. Quality assurance 

Quality assurance has almost always been done on my part. I as the developer need to make sure that the user should be able to have access to all their options and also prepare for the things that they might try to do that could lead to a fatal error. Testcases are something that can be used to help test and make sure as proof that these tasks do work too.
  
  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

Ai also has been used by me to use code already built by myself and expand on a certain concept, such as already having a navbar, now how do I make it collapse while keeping the base of my code for example?

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Ai has helped change my experience and understanding of usage with it. I always thought it was not something good to have in education and learning experience cause all I thought about was that it could be used to cheat

### IV. Practical Applications:
Outside of the ICS Field AI is something that can also help in any field that could help improve efficiency and completion of tasks. Unlike humans where there is a chance of human error, AI doesn’t necessarily fall under that risk unless there is some kind of error inside of the database itself.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
This of course leads to this point of the challenges of AI, there is still the fear of replacing fairly simple jobs that AI could instead handle itself. This leads to the whole theory that technology is gonna replace it all and causes the general population to be upset about this. However, again relying on it too much creates a much simpler pathway of handling tasks and would reduce overall creativity. It is best used to help continue developing creative ideas. 

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
When used in a teaching environment AI can be used to help many teachers produce a lecture within a much quicker period. But how they do so varies as the tool itself can create a certain view of an answer that may not be necessarily correct in all perspectives, mentioning again the limited usage of AI. Their version of modern society is only as good as what is known to them. This also means that when using AI to help teach students as part of class will also have to keep in mind that the student doesn’t lose so much social interaction and feel like this is the answer to all their problems. It is important that students continue to grow and make sure that they use AI to help them grow and not hurt their learning.
### VII. Future Considerations:
In the future, hopefully, AI will continue to develop and learn how to get the most up-to-date information needed to help people today. Maybe some kind of auto system to help grab from reliable sources. As for situations for jobs and schools, however, it will probably still stay at a point where everyone needs to watch how they use AI so that they don’t abuse it and hurt themselves. Unless they find a way for AI to learn on its own without grabbing biased information or from unconfirmed info, we will probably still need to take all information with a grain of salt and use it to help us the best we can.

### VIII. Conclusion:
Overall, AI continues to be a very useful tool in a society that has technology constantly growing and showing no signs of slowing down. It has its place in society as an additional tool but not as an exact replacement for something in society. It serves an extra for quality assistance and does as much as it can to help ASSIST in the production of a variety of new things!
