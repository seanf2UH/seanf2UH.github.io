The Professor Card Trading Game is a Group Project that I and three other members worked on to create our final project. For this game, students can initiate peer-to-peer connections with newly assigned cards at the start of each semester! These cards will be professors that have varying rarity and can be used to trade among students!
Professors will also have the chance to create special cards themselves to reward students for any kind of academic excellence of their choice!

```cpp
 {
  //Navbar Structure
            <div id="sidebar" className="collapse collapse-horizontal col-auto col-md-3 col-xl-2 px-sm-2 px-0 bg-danger">
              <div id="sidebar-nav" className="d-flex flex-column align-items-center align-items-sm-start px-1 pt-2 text-white min-vh-100">
```
Work done to help complete this project was mostly done through the front end. Responsibilities were focused on setting up the navigation bar and then creating the interface
needed to connect different pages and make them correspond appropriately based on the location of the user and to test that the entire program works in general through the form of test cases.
This was to ensure quality assurance to the user and to set the program to appear as my teammates intended based on whether the navigation bar was open or not.

Overall, this was a very enjoyable task to take on, while I was just working on the front end besides the test cases, making the adjustments to pages, and creating the navigation bar
has taken a bit of time thanks to also learning through experience and research of how the page should be set up based on the current context of the page. It helped me grow and learn 
thanks to the professors giving us a choice to go in our direction for this assignment.
